Tutorial Script:

Agenda:

1. Basic Operations

In this installment simply have the developers run the setup script without
discussing the details of what it exactly does. In a nutshell a "remote"
repository (albeit on the local file system) is created whose name is 'repo'.
Also two different developers repositories are created, 'paul' and 'mary'.

Once they run the setup script walk them through each operation detailed in
the 'basic' script.

In this installment developers will learn about:

* clone
* status
* add
* commit
* push
* diff
* difftool
* gitk

2. Fetching, Rebasing, and Merging Operations

After developers have worked through the first installment, walk them through the
commands detailed in the 'merge' script. The developers will be working in the
'mary' repository.

In this installment developers will learn about:

* fetch
* rebase
* merge
* mergetool

3. Advanced Operations

After developers have been fully prepared with the above material will they learn
about the more advanced topics, whose commands are detailed in the 'setup' script.

In this installment developers or release engineers will learn about:

* init
* init --bare
* remote add
* push (to remote refs)
