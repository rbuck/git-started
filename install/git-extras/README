Several configuration setters for Git are provided in this directory:

  install-p4merge.sh        - installs p4merge as the default diff and merge
                              tool


Perforce P4Merge

Perforce p4merge is recommended for interactive merges; this tool is freely
available from the web. Other merge and diff tools may be similarly configured
but this one is written by a commercial company and the tool has the polish
lacking in other tools. To install p4merge run the following script:

  sudo ./install-p4merge.sh


Other Recommended Extras:

Contributors are requested to document scripts to set up the config files to
support other diff and merge tools.
