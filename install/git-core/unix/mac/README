Installing Git on Mac OS X

There are three options for installing Git on Mac OS X:

* build and install git and all its dependencies from source
* install git using macports
* install git using homebrew
* install git using git-osx-installer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing Git from Source

In order to build and install Git from source code, first install MacPorts,
then after installing asiidoc and xmlto run the script provided with this
file.

  sudo port install asciidoc xmlto

Related instructions are available at the following site:

  http://github.com/guides/compiling-and-installing-git-on-mac-os-x

Mileage may vary. Zipped binary packages are available from Robert Buck upon
request.

A script to build all dependent packages exists at the following location:

  install/git-core/unix/source

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ports via Packaging Tools

Two packaging tool systems exist out of the normal flow of install packages and
the like for Macs: Homebrew and MacPorts. Both determine the dependencies for
the tool you wish to install (like yum or apt-get) and both download sources
then build the tools incrementally, installing them to /usr/local. Both require
XCode to be installed, which ships with it the GNU compiler collection.

Detailed regarding these install procedures may be found at:

  http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/

Homebrew

  http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew

Currently Homebrew supports Git 1.7.1. To install Git using Homebrew run the
following command:

  brew install git  

MacPorts

  http://www.macports.org/

Currently MacPorts supports Git 1.7.1. To install git, after MacPorts is
installed run the following command:

  sudo port install git-core

Installing Git using an OS X Installer
