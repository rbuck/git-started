Subject: Installation of Git on RedHat/CentOS 5.4 or Later
From: Robert Buck

The script (install.sh) installs Git and all its dependencies on CentOS/Redhat
version 5.4 or later. The script adds EPEL as a YUM repository, updates, and
upgrades the system. Mileage may vary.

Modify the script to not perform an update.

This script will NOT install the latest version of Git, it will only install
the version that was available at the time of the stable RedHat release.

It is recommended that version 1.7.2 or later is installed, and this may be
done from source code. See the source code directory for further instructions.

However, if you wish to install using pre-built RPMs then some are available at
the linux-kernel site, the key packages being 'git', 'gitk', 'git-email' and
'git-gui':
